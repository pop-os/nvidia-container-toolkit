# build-one jobs build packages for a single OS / ARCH combination.
#
# They are run during the first stage of the pipeline as a smoke test to ensure
# that we can successfully build packages on all of our architectures for a
# single OS. They are triggered on any change to an MR. No artifacts are
# produced as part of build-one jobs.

# build-all jobs build packages for every OS / ARCH combination we support.
#
# They are run under two conditions:
# 1) Automatically whenever a new tag is pushed to the repo (e.g. v1.1.0)
# 2) Manually by a reviewer just before merging a MR.
#
# Unlike build-one jobs, it takes a long time to build the full suite
# OS / ARCH combinations, so this is optimized to only run once per MR
# (assuming it all passes). A full set of artifacts including the packages
# built for each OS / ARCH are produced as a result of these jobs.
